QR1 (MainQR): [g^r,m*h^r]^k + [signature] + [partyId] + [timestamp] 
QR2 (AuditQR): [m,r]^k



QR1 size: (2*element_size)*k + signatureSize + partyIdSize + timeStampSize
QR2 size: (2*element_size)*k

comments: ^ = concatenation k times
		  disregard '[' , ']'  they're just to make the format clear.
		  there are no separators between different sections at each QR,
		  everything is concatenated straight forward.
